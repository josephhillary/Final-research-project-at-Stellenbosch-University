Lie group analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations (NLPDEs) makes use of symmetries of the NLPDE to find solutions and conservation laws.  The solutions describe the state of the system at all times and conservation laws give its invariant properties. NLPDEs have applications in many settings. However, finding exact solutions to such NLPDEs is a challenge because of the increased complexity since NLPDEs have many independent variables. In this dissertation, we propose to research on  Lie group analysis of a  nonlinear coupled system of Korteweg de-Vries (KdV) equations. To achieve this, we first introduce the mathematical concepts of Lie group analysis and conservation laws. As an illustrative example, we perform a Lie group analysis of the KdV equation. This means we find Lie point symmetries and compute invariant solutions. Conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy are also constructed for the KdV equation by the method of multipliers. Next, we focus on Lie group analysis of a nonlinear system of coupled KdV equations. We find symmetries of the coupled system and use them for symmetry reductions. We also compute invariant solutions for the coupled KdV equations. Furthermore, conservation laws are constructed by using multipliers and a theorem proposed by Nail Ibragimov. The target application for this dissertation is in systems that can be described by a KdV model. Particularly systems behaving like solitons which are traveling waves that do not change shape after a pair-wise collision.
